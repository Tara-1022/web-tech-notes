from nodejs.org

- open source javascript runtime environment
now possible to run JS outside of web browser
enables full stack web dev - server & client side; database code possible

- highly scalable, data-intensive, real time
- great for prototyping (agile development)

Ryan Dahl created a c++ program implementing JavaScript Engine from Google Chrome (V8) in 2009
- stand-alone app to execute JS code
- convert to machine code

used to implement back-end services; server-side RTE
- create API that can be accessed by web & mobile apps

**Features**
- Non-blocking async 
    - client does not need to wait
    - requests are added onto an event queue and fulfilled when data is ready
    - queue is continuously monitored & updated by the single thread; thread is not tied to a request
- single threaded app - handles all requests 


suitable for realtime, low CPU intensive tasks (not image processing, ml... since one pending requests makes others wait)

**Use**
- create .js file
- execute as node <file>.js


**Module**
- JS file with data & functionality. Every js file is a module
- built in modules:
    - http: to create server; HTTP Protocol services (response + request)
    - fs: file system
    - os: operating system
- can be user defined (obv)

most developers write functionality & export
